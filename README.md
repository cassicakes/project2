##Approach

- First night I brainstormed ideas, thinking of things I enjoy doing, am interested in, and an app I would want myself that would be very simple due to my capabilites. I also reached out to friends and family about what their favorite apps are, why, and what they could change about it if possible. I also asked them what app they wish existed.

- I finalized my idea choice based upon finding an API with enough data.

- I wire framed every view, pop up, and documented what I would want to happen on each page. I also wire framed ORM functioning. Also browsed CSS ideas and color schemes

- Again like last project I started doing what I knew to do, which was build my very basic views, and routes for al main peieces. (pages, buttons, imputs, links, input feilds, nav bar, etc.)

- Once I had the basic layout I paired with someone to build the funcitonality in steps. I explained exactly what I wanted to do (which I noted thorughout the whole process), and together we went step by step to achive the funcitoing I desired.
